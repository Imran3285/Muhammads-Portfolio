# Intelligent Aerial Manipulation System

This project involved the development of an advanced quadcopter utilizing the SpeedyBee F7 microcontroller and an onboard mini camera to perform real-time object detection and tracking through computer vision.

## Key Features
- **Hardware**: SpeedyBee F7 flight controller, mini FPV camera
- **Payload Capacity**: Up to 10 kg of surveillance equipment
- **Range**: Operational radius of 800 meters
- **Core Objective**: Design a cost-effective and efficient drone system for surveillance and object tracking in hard-to-reach or hostile environments

## Applications
The project was designed with a focus on strengthening Pakistanâ€™s defense capabilities by enabling aerial surveillance in areas that are otherwise inaccessible.

## Support & Funding
This initiative was successfully completed with funding and support from the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Pakistan.
