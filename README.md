# Hi there !
I am Muhammad Imran, a results-driven Master's student in Data Science for Business with a strong engineering background. My proficiency in Python, MATLAB, Power BI, and statistics has empowered me to develop advanced technical skills and apply them to real-world challenges.
I have developed predictive models, built intelligent systems, and delivered actionable insights across diverse domains — from healthcare and telecom to industrial automation, strategic consulting, and public sector innovation. Notably, I contributed to a consultancy project aimed at leveraging data science to enhance and improve transport accessibility in Scotland, using data-driven insights to support inclusive and sustainable mobility solutions.
My academic and project work reflects a passion for innovation, a commitment to continuous learning, and a drive to make data meaningful. I’m eager to contribute to organizations that value creativity, collaboration, and impact. Whether it’s optimizing business processes, designing smart systems, or crafting data stories that drive decisions, I bring a blend of technical depth, strategic thinking, and real-world experience to the table.
